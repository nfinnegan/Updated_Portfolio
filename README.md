# Updated_Portfolio

## Project Overview

This project was a complete overhaul of version 1 of my original Professional Portfolio. I wanted to incorporate more of the things I've learned in version 2 and look forward to continue to iterate on it.

## Description

Having finished the 8th week of bootcamp, I have a larger breadth and depth of knowledge than I did during week two. My efforts put forth in this version of my Portfolio hopefully display that progress. It currently displays an About Me section, 3 highlighted projects, and links to my resume/github/linkedin/email/twitter/spotify (some displayed in About Me, others in the footer)

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap
4. Font Awesome
5. Google Fonts
